As such, the corresponding mathematical models and their simulations are central tools to guide political decision-making. Typically, ODE-based models are considered, in which fractions of infected and healthy individuals change deterministically and continuously over time. In this work, we translate an ODE-based COVID-19 spreading model from literature to a stochastic multi-agent system and use a contact network to mimic complex interaction structures. We observe a large dependency of the epidemic&#x27;s dynamics on the structure of the underlying contact graph, which is not adequately captured by existing ODE-models. For instance, existence of super-spreaders leads to a higher infection peak but a lower death toll compared to interaction structures without super-spreaders. Overall, we observe that the interaction structure has a crucial impact on the spreading dynamics, which exceeds the effects of other parameters such as the basic reproduction number R0. We conclude that deterministic models fitted to COVID-19 outbreak data have limited predictive power or may even lead to wrong conclusions while stochastic models taking interaction structure into account offer different and probably more realistic epidemiological insights.","date":"Sun, 03 May 2020 16:00:00 GMT","doi":"10.1101/2020.05.05.20091736","entities":[{"label":"predictive power","url":"http://xlore.org/instance/eni507306"},{"label":"basic reproduction number","url":"http://xlore.org/instance/eni292821"},{"label":"multi-agent system","url":"http://xlore.org/instance/eni298066"},{"label":"deterministic models","url":"http://xlore.org/instance/eni202713"},{"label":"deterministically","url":"http://xlore.org/instance/eni240395"},{"label":"epidemiological","url":"http://xlore.org/instance/eni32622"},{"label":"infection","url":"https://covid-19.aminer.cn/kg/resource/R10508"},{"label":"COVID-19","url":"https://covid-19.aminer.cn/kg/resource/R332"},{"label":"outbreak","url":"https://covid-19.aminer.cn/kg/resource/R1591"},{"label":"Epidemic","url":"https://covid-19.aminer.cn/kg/class/epidemic"},{"label":"virus","url":"https://covid-19.aminer.cn/kg/class/virus"}],"geoInfo":[],"id":"5f074b1f9e795e1a9f4af11c","lang":"","pdf":"https://static.aminer.cn/upload/pdf/1592/840/1647/5f074b1f9e795e1a9f4af11c_0.pdf","seg_text":"import interact structur stochast epidem spread : A covid - 19 case studi In recent covid - 19 pandem , comput simul use predict evolut viru propag evalu prospect effect non - pharmaceut intervent .

Numerical simulations show that strict suppression measures at the beginning of an epidemic can create low infectious numbers, which thereafter can be managed by mitigation measures over longer periods to flatten the epidemic curve. The stronger the suppression measure, the faster it achieves the low numbers of infections that are conducive to subsequent management. We discuss the predictions of this analysis and how it fits into longer-term sequences of measures, including using the herd immunity concept to leverage acquired immunity.
